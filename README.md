The Overlook Hotel is a pure Vanilla JS application created for the end of the Front End Engineering program, Module 2 of the Turing School of Software and Design. It allows the user to view and sort available hotels rooms by date, and uses API calls to retrieve current room and booking information, as well as to create and delete reservations.
